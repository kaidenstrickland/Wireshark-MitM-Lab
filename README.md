<h1>Traffic Analysis Using Wireshark</h1>

<h2>Objective</h2>
The objective of this project was to conduct a deep-packet analysis of unencrypted network traffic to demonstrate the vulnerability of plaintext protocols. By capturing and reconstructing sensitive login credentials transmitted using HTTP, this lab serves as a proof-of-concept for the risks of data interception and highlights the need for end-to-end encryption using HTTPS.
<br />

<h2>Project Summary</h2>
This project demonstrates a successful Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) analysis within a controlled virtual environment. By intercepting traffic between a victim workstation and a web server, I successfully identified critical vulnerabilities in unencrypted protocols, including the exposure of plaintext credentials and session data.
